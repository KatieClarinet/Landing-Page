    author: "Kiran Millwood Hargrave",
    title: "The Mercies",
    review: `The Mercies takes us back to a small Norwegian island in the 1600s, where one day a storm descends, massacring all the men in an moment. Under the rule of King Christian IV, there is a spreading suspicion of witchcraft, and a commissioner is summoned to the island to ensure that Christian law prevails.
    
    Hargraves’s writing is so immersive, I felt consumed by the smells and sights of the island, really connecting to the bleak and onerous lives of the women survivors. 
    Bound by the laws of the time, they are faced with a dilemma: to risk persecution for taking on ‘the role of men’ by providing for themselves, or to wait and see what god will provide.
    
    Reading this made me think of The Crucible (anyone else study this at school?) and how the whole community is torn apart for fear of being accused of witchcraft. Such a compelling storyline! I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and magic realism.`,

    "author": "Octavia E. Butler",
    "title": "Kindred",
    "review": `In 1976, Dana is a 26 year old black American trying to make it as a writer, until  one day she is summoned back in time to save a dying white boy, Rufus. The year is 1815 and, due to the colour of her skin, she is danger and assumed a slave by all who meet her.
    
    Dana is caught between the past and the present time, tortured by the knowledge that slavery will be abolished in the future, but knowing that will not help her friends of the time. Adamant that she will not be a slave, she tries to advocate for black rights but her actions are hindered by the antebellum laws of the time.
    
    A heart-wrenching read, Butler brings to life the unimaginable horrors of black slavery and makes us consider: what does it take to make a person a slave? The scary reality is, it takes less than we think.
    
    Not an easy read (there is no glossing over the hard bits in the book) but a fantastic, thought provoking one. My first book by Butler but definitely not my last!`,

    "author": "Megan Hunter",
    "title": "The Harpy",
    "review": `“I used to imagine her anger as a parasite that lived in her stomach, that passed through the wall of her womb to my mother, who passed it to me.”
    
    When Lucy finds out her husband Jake has been cheating on her, they devise a plan to even the playing field: she will hurt him 3 times. He will not know when, and in what form, the hurt will take.
    
    Hunter is a very skilled writer and has triumphed in creating such a disturbing story that at times reading this I felt physically sick. She intersperses each chapter with details of Lucy’s obsession with the mythical harpy. The more Lucy hurts Jake, the less ‘human’ she becomes.
    
    This book was too sinister for me, however it is beautifully written, rich in symbolism and very cleverly put together. I would be interested to see what Hunter’s other books are like as I think I could enjoy her writing if the subject matter is different. However, I vehemently disliked this one.`,

    "author": "Malala Yousafzai",
    "title": "I am Malala",
    "review": `I bought this on audible a year or so ago, but now seemed such a pertinent time to finally listen to it considering the terrifying attacks from the Taliban happening right now.

    Malala’s story is not only incredibly inspiring, but she manages to infuse a lighthearted humour as she reminds us that, despite the ordeal she has survived, she is still an girl like any other, who argues with her siblings and enjoys watching American comedies.
    
    Her unwavering commitment to female education and rights is truly humbling. I would recommend this book to everyone, but if you can listen to the Audiobook instead you also get to hear Malala’s speech at the UN.`,

    "author": "Jessica Andrews",
    "title": "Saltwater",
    "review": `Saltwater is a character driven novel, with a non-linear plot.
    
    From her childhood in Sunderland, to studying at university in London, to her early 20s in Ireland, Saltwater is the story of a girl called Lucy trying to find herself.
    
    Saltwater flits between present time and memories so smoothly that I lost all sense of the concept of time when reading. When people say ‘my life flashed before my eyes’ this is how I felt reading this book! Not for my life - but for Lucy’s.
    
    Lucy’s childhood memories are written with such sensory descriptions that I felt like I was living each moment with her, yet Andrews cleverly intersperses happy moments alongside the more troubled goings on in Lucy’s life until it’s all quite jumbled and unpredictable. Personally, I really enjoyed this writing style!
    
    If you want a book where you get lost in someone else’s life for a while, this one’s for you.`,

    "author": "Clare Chambers",
    "title": "Small Pleasures",
    "review": `Between her job at the local paper, and home life looking after her elderly mother, Jean, an almost 40 year old journalist, is living a life of monotony until one day a women writes in claiming to have given birth to a daughter, whilst still a virgin.

    When none of her male colleagues wishes to waste their time on such a ‘crank’ story, it falls to Jean’s lot to investigate the claim. When Jean meets Gretchen and her ‘miracle’ daughter, little does she know of the impact they will bring to her life.
    
    I think Chambers has put together what could have been quite an interesting plot here, and I did quite warm to some of the characters, in particular, Margaret (I thought her ‘angel voices’ were a clever yet subtle nod to the conclusion), and the quirky aunt Edie.
    
    However, after a strong start, I think Chamber’s got a big complacent with the storyline. I’m not a huge fan of romance as a genre, and I found the long-awaited turn around in Jean’s love life a bit tiresome and predictable. A mediocre read, in my opinion.`,

    "author": "Sarah Winman",
    "title": "Still Life",
    "review": `Ulysses, a young British soldier, and Evelyn, a mature art historian, share a chance encounter in a wine cellar during a bombing raid of the Second World War. With Ulysses’ infectious optimism for life and Evelyn’s passion for Italian Renaissance artwork, they leave a lasting impression on each other that long outlives their brief meeting. 
    
    Winman has outdone herself with this cast of raw, honest characters and addresses the complexities of their relationships with a mischievous satire. She explores love in all its forms, and human resilience in the face of disaster. The result is this uplifting beacon of hope.
    
    I’ve yet to find a Winman book that I didn’t adore. So far I’ve also read When God Was a Rabbit and Tin Man. I’ve got a Year of Marvellous Ways on my TBR shelf but I’m saving it as something to look forward to!`,

    "author": "Jennifer Saint",
    "title": "Elektra",
    "review": `‘Nothing brought them more joy than the fall of a lovely woman’.
    
    SYNOPSIS
    Based on the Trojan War, Elektra follows the story of three women, all impacted by the curse of the House of Atreus:
    Clytemnestra, Cassandra and Elektra.
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    In an exhilerating retelling of the Trojan War, Jennifer Saint brings to life the Ancient Greek Gods in this bloodthirsty story of prophecy and revenge. Told from the perspectives of women, we are taken on a journey of glory, ruin, despair, and, at the heart of it all, a mother’s love.
    
    Really recommend this to lovers of mythical fiction! I won this proof copy in an instragram giveaway by the lovely @tillylovesbooks.
    Elektra will be published on 3 May 2022.`,

    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    Ruth Butterham is a young, impoverished, seamstress awaiting trial for murder. Dorothea Truelove is a wealthy lady fascinated with phrenology, the hypothesis that the shape of a person's skull can affect their actions. When she visits prison to meets Ruth, she hears a story of murder by needle and thread. The question is, is Ruth mad, or a murderer?
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    Purcell has a real skill for taking the mundane and making it creepy as hell! In this book she explores the fine line between love and hate, and the consequences of poverty.
    
    I didn’t love this quite as much as The Silent Companions, but still definitely recommend to fans of historical fiction and gothic horror!

    "author": "Jess Kidd",
    "title": "The Night Ship",
    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    A parallel tale of two lives, The Night Ship switches between the story of Maryken, a Dutch child in the early 1600s, and Gil, an Australian boy in the late 1900s.
    Under the charge of her nursemaid, Imke, Maryken embarks on the long and arduous journey to Batavia, where she will be delivered to her father, a rich merchant she has never met. Centuries later, Gil is sent to stay on Beacon Island with his unwelcoming grandfather.
    
    As both stories unfold, so do uncanny similarities between the past and present, and Gil learns of a shipwreck that still haunts the islands inhabitants today.
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    A reimagining of true events, this is a captivating tale that engrossed me from start to finish. Told from the perspective of children, Kidd cleverly builds up an engrossing world of monsters and old wives tales, meanwhile the real dangers lie in the real world. I did shed a tear at the end of this book, which is rare for me, so I definitely felt emotionally connected to the story.
    
    A few small issues I had: I felt like some of Kidd’s descriptions of characters were quite repetitive (she describes multiple characters as having ‘wolfish’ mannerisms and it just seemed a bit unoriginal/I couldn’t see where she was going with that) and, I would have liked a more thorough explanation of some of the connections between characters across the centuries. That being said, I absolutely recommend this book - particularly for fans of historical fiction and magical realism!
    
    Thanks to @netgalley for the advanced e-copy of this book, which will be published Thursday 4th August 2022.`,

    "author": "Anthony Doerr",
    "title": "Cloud Cuckoo Land",
    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    Cloud Cuckoo Land is a rich tapestry of time, threaded with characters from the past, present and future. Doerr details the lives of children during the Fall of Constantinople in the 1400s, soldiers in the Korean War 1950s, and future implications of the ongoing war of humankind against our planet Earth. 
    
    Each chapter is interspersed with verses from a humorous, (and, at times, slightly ridiculous!) Ancient Greek fable that has been passed down through the generations, with each character finding meaning in the story. 
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    I can’t recommend this book enough. Doerr has blended together a myriad of genres and, it shouldn’t work, but somehow it does! It’s a mad ride of book, but I think he’s really summed up the ‘essence’ of life with this story of imperfect characters adapting to the world and its gradual changes. Favourite book this year so far!`,

    "title": "The Good Samaritan",
    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    Laura is a volunteer for ‘End of the Line’, a charity for people to call when they need someone to listen to their troubles. A sweet and caring mother of two, she is known for her homemade cakes and skills with a sewing machine. However, there’s more to Laura than meets the eye…
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    I only really listened to this as it was £1 on audible (and I do love a bargain!), however I found it to be a really addictive listen! I was a little apprehensive when there was such a big twist around halfway through, as I thought it might be all downhill from there, however Marrs keeps the twists and turns coming right up til the end.
    
    Laura is a really loathsome and complicated character, and I couldn’t wait for her history to unravel to learn more about how she came to be the way she is. The ending felt satisfying and not overly farfetched in the way that some thrillers can. If you’re going to pick this one up, just be aware that suicide is a main subject throughout, so it’s pretty dark.`,

    "title": "Once Upon a River",
    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    1900s. On the evening of the Winter Solstice, the regulars at an inn on the Thames are shocked to find their celebrations disturbed by the arrival of an injured man holding the corpse of a drowned child. Nobody knows who the injured man or child are, and the mystery only increases when, hours later, the girl begins to breathe again, and two seperate fathers arrive to claim her.
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    This book ticked a lot of boxes for me: historical fiction, mystery, and a fascination with the river. Personally, I am always drawn towards water. I long to live near the sea one day, and am always more content when near any sort of reservoir. So, in a way, I think that there is something a little magical about water, and I enjoyed getting swept away with this enchanting story.
    
    I’m sure that fans of Stacey Halls and Laura Purcell would enjoy this!`,

    "review": `‘I want to meet the millionaire of American sadness. I want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, “It’s been an honor to serve my country.”’
    
    SYNOPSIS
    Through a collection of letters, a young Vietnamese man retells his life story to his mother, who cannot read.
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    Vuong breaks down the boundaries of social niceties with his writing, juxtaposing each subject (abuse, homophobia, addition, to name a few) with the most opulent language. Mesmerising, vulnerable, and uncomfortable, the story of Little Dog is loosely inspired by his own life as a queer Asian-American.

    The ‘one to watch’ at university, Irina’s reputation as a photographer has since dwindled, and she balances her passion for taking transgressive, explicit photographs of average-looking men alongside her job as a bartender. When she is invited to show her work at a fashionable London gallery she becomes fixated on her art, at the cost of those around her.

    A feisty femme fatal, Irina turns gender stereotypes on their head in her obsessive urge to break boundaries. Kudos to Clarke for creating a character both endearingly awkward yet viscerally repugnant!

    "review": `SYNOPSIS
    Korea, 1911. Club-footed, cleft-lipped Hoonie and and his wife Yangjin are besotted with their daughter Sunja, but they worry that she will never marry, for suitors fear that she will carry bad genes. When Sunja becomes pregnant by a married gangster she will not name, a Christian minister, whom she has nursed from tuberculosis, wants to help her. The minister, Isak, and Sunja marry and begin a new life in Japan together. 
    
    MY THOUGHTS
    Pachinko spans several generations of a Korean family during the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. A mesmerising tale of hardship and loss, it centres around the long history of discrimination against Koreans in Japan.
    
    Published 30+ years after Min Jin Lee first came up with the idea, this rich saga has been influenced by many interviews with Korean Japanese people and brings to light the cruelty of being treated as a visitor in the country in which you were born.`,
