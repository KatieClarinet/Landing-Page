          My favourite genres are contemporary and historical fiction.
          <br>There’s little I enjoy more than having a good browse around the charity shops for books,<br> although I do also love a library visit.
          <br>One book I always recommend is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.

      <h3>
        NADIFA MOHAMED<br>
        The Fortune Men</h3>
      <p id="text">SYNOPSIS<br>
        Tiger Bay, Cardiff, 1952. When shopkeeper Violet Volacki has her throat slit one night, witnesses report that a ‘coloured man’ was seen on her doorstep that night. Mahmood Mattan, a Somali sailor, finds himself the source of suspicion. Yes, he is guilty of shoplifting, but no, he is not a murderer. Will justice save this innocent man?
        <br><br>
        MY THOUGHTS<br>
        The story of a black man being falsely persecuted is sadly nothing new, and the fact that this is based on real events from only 70 years ago is even more disheartening.
        <br>
        Mohamed creates an atmospheric vision of Tiger Bay, brimming with workers from around the world. Her characters are complex and flawed, particularly Mattan who is a petty thief separated from his family. Throughout the story we get to see how his life experiences have shaped him, and, during his lengthy period of contemplation in prison, to witness his unequivocal optimism that the truth will save him. A raw and characterful retelling that seems bitterly pertinent to our time.

      <h3>AFIA ATAKORA<br>
        Conjure Women</h3>
      <p id="text">
        SYNOPSIS<br>
        Set in the 1800s on a slave plantation, Conjure Women follows the life of Rue, the local healer and midwife. When a baby is born with unusually dark eyes, the superstitious community start to question her powers, and instead put their trust in a visiting preacher man.
        <br><br>
        MY THOUGHTS<br>
        This book left me feeling bereft in the way that only a great book can. Atakora paints a vivid picture of strong women surviving in times of oppresion, with a simmering undercurrent of secrets that are only revealed at the very end. I felt so attached to the characters she created (influenced by Slave Interviews in the 1930s - Author’s Note!)

      <h3>ELIF SHAFAK<br>
        Honour</h3>
      <p id="text">SYNOPSIS<br>
        Adem and Pembe are twin sisters, born to a mother desperate for a son. Although as they grow up they go their separate ways, with Pembe moving to London and Aden remaining in Syria, their lives remain irrevocably entwined.
        <br><br>
        This story centres around the cultural belief that women are secondary to men. It is a women’s job to preserve the family honour, and there are consequences in store for women who don’t.
        <br><br>
        MY THOUGHTS<br>
        I absolutely adore Shafak’s lyrical writing style, and felt transported to each location she described. Whilst we know from early on that there will be sadness in this story, there are moments of such exquisite joy that it’s impossible not to feel attached to the characters. I thought I knew where the story was going, but there were twists along the way I could never have expected.
        <br><br>
        I really recommend this book! My first Shafak, but if her other books are anywhere near as good she will become an auto buy author for me.
